This steamlit interactive web application uses my loptop's webcam to demonstrate real-time image processing with customizable filters.
Built with Python's OpenCV library, it applies visual effects like grayscale conversion and edge detection that users can
toggle on/off through a simple Streamlit interface. The program features adjustable sliders to control the intensity of the 
edge detection effect and includes a snapshot button to capture processed images with timestamped filenames.in the behind the code, 
it handles color space conversions between BGR, RGB, and grayscale formats to ensure proper display across different operations.
While serving as an educational example of computer vision basics, this application showcases practical implementation of
real-time video processing, user interface controls, and image manipulation techniques.
