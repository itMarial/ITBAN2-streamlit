This Streamlit app creates a simple user management system that connects to a MySQL database.
It shows all registered users in a table, allows new signups through a form, and
verifies logins by checking credentials against the database. The app uses Python
with SQLAlchemy for database connections and Pandas to handle the data, while
Streamlit provides the web interface.  This is a demo only it display in the top 
what stored in the DB
